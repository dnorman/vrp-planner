# Evaluation Plan

## Goal

Create a reproducible benchmark suite to validate constraint correctness and solution quality.

## Deliverables

- Synthetic fixtures (20–100 visits, 3–10 visitors).
- Constraint-focused tests (pins, windows, breaks, skills).
- Baseline greedy solver for comparison.
- Metrics report format.

## Steps

1. Define fixture generator inputs (seed, size, constraints).
2. Implement baseline greedy solver (construction only).
3. Add validation checks for hard constraints.
4. Record metrics (distance, time, violations, balance).
